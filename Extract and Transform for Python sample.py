#my data cleaning! These files have a lot of information on Cattle in them, but I'm only interested in the number of sheep sold. I can get that information from these flat text files with a little bit of general data munging, like so:

import pandas as pd

# create an empty dataframe for our clean data
cleaned_data = pd.DataFrame()

# we'll use these labels in each loop, so it's more efficient
# to declare them out of the loop
column_labels = ["category","head_sold"]

# loop through every .txt file in our target directory
for file in glob.glob("../input/lamb-auction-data/*.txt"):
   
    # read in all the data for a specific file (they're small
    # so this shouldn't be a big problem)
    data = open(file).read()
   
    # find # of head sold
    sales = re.findall('(lamb|ram|ewe|wether|sheep).* (.*) head', data.lower())
    
    # name of market (always on fourth line)
    market = data.split(sep="\n")[3]

    # date reported
    reported = re.findall("Richmond, VA(.*)", data)
    date = dparser.parse(reported[0],fuzzy=True).date()

    # only proceed from here if there was one or more sales
    if len(sales) > 0:
        
        df_temp = pd.DataFrame.from_records(sales, columns=column_labels)
        df_temp["market"] = market
        df_temp["date_reported"] = date

    # add data about markets with no sheep sales
    else:
        df_temp = pd.DataFrame(data={"category": ["none"], "head_sold": [0]})
        df_temp["market"] = market
        df_temp["date_reported"] = date
    
    # append data to our cleaned data
    cleaned_data = cleaned_data.append(df_temp, ignore_index=True)
# now let's take a peek at the cleaned data and make sure it looks good
#cleaned_data


# save our data as a .csv file
cleaned_data.to_csv("path to save file(.. to go up directory/cleaned_relevant_data.csv", index=False)
